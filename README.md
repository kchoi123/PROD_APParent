# APP@rent

<b><u>Summary:</u></b><br></br>
In this project, we built APP@rent - an app for parents. Parenthood is great but let's face it, it can also be very challenging! The idea was then to create an app to help parents meet other parents, help one another, share tips, events....

Each parent creates a personal account by filling up a sign-up form and give some information about them (without being intrusive). Then, every parent can look through the "catalog" of members and connect with parents that live in the same area, whose kids go to the same school, have the same age… They can also share external events through the app and share tricks and tips (discounts on kid supplies, summer camp info, kid activities info, educational tips, donation of clothes, toys etc…).
